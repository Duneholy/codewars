    "# Everyone knows passphrases. One can choose passphrases from poems, songs, \n",

    "\n",
    "# choose a text in capital letters including or not digits and non alphabetic characters,\n",
    "\n",
    "# shift each letter by a given number but the transformed letter must be a letter (circular shift),\n",

    "# keep such as non alphabetic and non digit characters,\n",
    "# downcase each letter in odd position, upcase each letter in even position (the first character is in position 0),\n",
